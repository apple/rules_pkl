# How to Contribute

## Formatting

Starlark files should be formatted by buildifier.
We suggest using a pre-commit hook to automate this.
First [install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation),
then run

```shell
pre-commit install
```

Otherwise, later tooling on CI will inform you about formatting/linting violations.

## Updating BUILD files

Some targets are generated from sources.
Currently, this is just the `bzl_library` targets.
Run `bazel run //:gazelle` to keep them up-to-date.

## Updating maven lock files

Once the `MODULE.bazel` and `//pkl:private:constants.bzl` files have been updated, you
can update the maven lock files using:

```
bazel run @unpinned_rules_pkl_deps//:pin
bazel run @unpinned_custom_pkl_java_library_maven_deps//:pin
```

## Using this as a development dependency of other rules

You'll commonly find that you develop in another WORKSPACE, such as
some other ruleset that depends on rules_pkl, or in a nested
WORKSPACE in the integration_tests folder.

To always tell Bazel to use this directory rather than some release
artifact or a version fetched from the internet, run this from this
directory:

```sh
OVERRIDE="--override_repository=rules_pkl=$(pwd)/rules_pkl"
echo "common $OVERRIDE" >> ~/.bazelrc
```

This means that any usage of `@rules_pkl` on your system will point to this folder.

## Releasing

1. Determine the next release version, following semver (could automate in the future from changelog)
2. Use the GitHub UI to tag the repo with the next release version and create a release
